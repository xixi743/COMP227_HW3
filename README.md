# COMP227 Game Design
#### Spring 2020 with Professor Chen @ Occidental College

### Homework 2

For this homework assignment we were asked to create a game featuring a farmer as the main character. The farmer grows different kinds of crops. The different kinds of crops will require different amounts of times to ripen. Once a crop is ready to harvest, the character will walk over to the crop and harvest it.
